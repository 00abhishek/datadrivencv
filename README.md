# datadrivencv

Ever feel a pit of dread when you need to add something to your resume or CV? You'll have to add it, then make sure the formatting didn't get messed up. What about changing to a new template/style? Better warm up your ctr-c ctrl-p fingers. 

`datadrivencv` separates the CV format from the content using spreadsheets, `RMarkdown`, and `Pagedown` packages. It's built to allow easy out-of-the-box behavior, but also to allow you to easily go beyond the defaults with customization and lack of lock-in to a given format.
